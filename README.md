## Problem-solving Showcase

This project is a showcase of problem-solving skills and consists of various algorithms from different areas, including
graphs, sorting algorithms, and binary trees. The algorithms are of different difficulty levels and have been
implemented using Java.

### Highlights of implemented algorithms

#### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Counting Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

#### Binary Tree Algorithms

- Binary Search Tree (BST) Creation
- Preorder Traversal
- Inorder Traversal
- Postorder Traversal
- Level-order Traversal

#### Graph Algorithms

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)


#### Other

- stack problems
- queue problems
- string processing (palindromes, common prefixes, duplicate letter removal)

### Technical Stack Used

The algorithms have been implemented using the following:

- Java 17
- Junit 5
- Mockito
- Gradle 7.4

### Getting Started

To run the algorithms, you need to have one of the above programming languages installed on your system. Clone the
repository to your local machine.
